# pygame-initilizer
Checks to see if pygame is available, if it is, it will open any window of your choice. If pygame is not detected it closes the window. (Grab lines 1-10 to only check to see if pygame is avalible and not open any windows)


This is a software used to check the avalibility of pygame and to check if it has been activiated. It will open the window if you select all the code to show it's working
and will send a message in the console saying "Successfully initialized pygame." However, if this is the opposite, the window will not open and will say to the console,
"Unable to initialize pygame." Very simple and easy to make.

(Lines 12-26 dont have to be selected. As it will send a message to the console either way. But it's perferred just in case you don't see the message.)
(Lines 1-10 have to be selected for this program to work.)
(There will be hastags planted around the code to explain it's meaning.)
